# Steganography
Steganography with Least Significant Bit method and java Implementation

Image Requirement 

- Bit Depth    = 32bit (ARGB)

- Format       = PNG

For make sure about the requirement you can take look at Detail Of Image.PNG

To use this project you need to change the image_path and output_path, you can change the message in variable message.

- image_path   = path of cover image that you want to use

- output_path  = path where you want to generate the stegano image

The output of this program is secret message text, cause line 11 is generating process, and line 12 reading the steganography image.

You can add some encryption algorithm for increase the security level.
